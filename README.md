live-mandelbox
==============

Android application Live Mandelbox (development version).

This application is a live wallpaper that uses FilterScript to calculate
MandelBox imagery and then displays it on homescreen with planar projection
allowing the view to rotate rather than scroll when user flips between
homescreen pages.

Originally a paid application, the low interest suggests that the application
may just as well be free.
